## ⚠️ One Important Thing

### Data Persistence

Your app currently uses **file-based storage** (CSV/JSON files).

**What this means:**
- ✅ Works perfectly for testing/demos
- ⚠️ Data resets on each deployment
- ⚠️ Data may be lost after periods of inactivity

**For production use**, consider adding a database:
- **Vercel Postgres** (free tier) ⭐ Recommended
- **Supabase** (free tier)
- **MongoDB Atlas** (free tier)

See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for database setup instructions.

**For now:** The current setup is perfect for deploying and testing!

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Faster performance
- 🚀 Free hosting on Vercel
