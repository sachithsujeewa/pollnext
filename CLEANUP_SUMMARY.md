## Benefits of Cleanup

✅ **Smaller project size** - Easier to download/clone
✅ **Faster deployments** - Less files to process
✅ **Clearer structure** - No confusion about which code to use
✅ **Easier navigation** - Only relevant files visible
✅ **Better for Git** - Smaller repository size

## Git History

If you ever need the old Angular or .NET code:

```bash
# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Find the commit before cleanup
git log --all --full-history -- angularapp/

# Checkout old version to a new branch
git checkout <commit-hash> -b old-version

# Or just view old files
git show <commit-hash>:angularapp/src/app/app.component.ts
```

---

## Verification

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

All should work perfectly! ✅
