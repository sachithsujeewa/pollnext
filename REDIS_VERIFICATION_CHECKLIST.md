# ✅ Redis Integration Verification Checklist

Follow this checklist to verify your Redis (Vercel KV) integration is working correctly.

## Prerequisites Check

- [x] Redis database created in Vercel
- [ ] Redis connected to your project
- [ ] Code deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Environment variables configured

## Step-by-Step Verification

### 1. Verify Redis Database Connection in Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your project (ASKAKD2)
3. Click **"Storage"** tab
4. You should see your KV database listed

**Expected:** ✅ Database shows as "Connected"

### 2. Check Environment Variables

1. In Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Look for these variables:
   - `KV_REST_API_URL`
   - `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
   - `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`

**Expected:** ✅ All three variables should be present

### 3. Deploy the Updated Code

```bash
# From your project directory
git add -A
git commit -m "Integrate Redis for persistent storage"
git push
```

**Expected:** ✅ Vercel automatically deploys the changes

### 4. Check Build Logs

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check the build logs for errors

**Expected:** ✅ Build succeeds without errors

### 5. Test Adding a Question

1. Visit your deployed app
2. Add a new question
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Refresh the page

**Expected:** ✅ Question should still be visible after refresh

### 6. Test Data Persistence (Important!)

1. Add 2-3 questions to your app
2. Wait 20-30 minutes (let serverless function restart)
3. Visit your app again
4. Check if questions are still there

**Expected:** ✅ All questions should still be visible

### 7. Verify Data in Redis (Vercel Dashboard)

1. Go to Storage → Your KV Database
2. Click **"Data"** tab
3. Look for these keys:
   - `questions` - Should contain array of questions
   - `members` - Should contain array of members (if any registered)

**Expected:** ✅ Keys exist and contain your data

### 8. Check Function Logs

1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click **"Logs"** tab
3. Look for any Redis-related errors

**Expected:** ✅ No errors like "KV_REST_API_URL is not defined"

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "KV_REST_API_URL is not defined"

**Cause:** Redis not connected to project or environment variables not set

**Solution:**
1. Go to Storage → Your KV Database
2. Click **"Connect to Project"**
3. Select your project
4. Redeploy your application

### Issue: Questions still disappear after waiting

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Old deployment is still active**
   - Check deployment timestamp
   - Make sure latest commit is deployed
   
2. **Redis not connected**
   - Verify in Storage tab
   - Should show "Connected" status

3. **Environment variables not set**
   - Check Settings → Environment Variables
   - Should have all 3 KV variables

**Solution:**
```bash
# Force a new deployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force redeploy with Redis"
git push
```

### Issue: Build fails with TypeScript errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors locally
npm run build

# Fix any errors shown
# Then commit and push
```

### Issue: Local development not working

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Pull environment variables
vercel env pull .env.local

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## Performance Test

Once everything is working, test the performance:

1. **Add 10 questions rapidly**
   - Should all save successfully
   
2. **Like/unlike questions**
   - Should update immediately
   
3. **Refresh page**
   - All questions should load
   - Likes should be preserved

## Data Verification Commands

If you have Vercel CLI installed:

```bash
# Pull environment variables
vercel env pull .env.local

# Check if variables are set
cat .env.local | grep KV_REST_API_URL
```

## Final Verification

After completing all steps above:

- [ ] Questions persist across refreshes
- [ ] Questions persist after 20+ minutes
- [ ] Questions persist after new deployments
- [ ] No errors in Vercel logs
- [ ] Data visible in Redis dashboard
- [ ] Local development works (with env vars)

## Success Indicators

✅ **Your Redis integration is working if:**
- Questions survive page refreshes
- Questions survive 20+ minutes of inactivity
- Questions survive new deployments
- No console errors related to Redis
- Data visible in Vercel KV dashboard

## Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check deployment logs** in Vercel Dashboard
2. **Review `REDIS_SETUP.md`** for detailed setup
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
4. **Ensure Redis is connected** to your project

## Next Steps

Once verification is complete:

✅ Your app is production-ready!
✅ Data persists permanently
✅ No more data loss on deployments

**Optional enhancements:**
- Add data backup functionality
- Implement Redis caching strategies
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Add rate limiting with Redis
